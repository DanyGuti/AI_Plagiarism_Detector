# 1. Get the column of the problem, sort the indexes, start at max index + 1, make new dirs in data/cases case-0{i}
# 2. Create two classifications/folders plagiarized non-plagiarized
# 3. Point to the first problem (based on sorted), access both the index hashes (from the current
    # row pair of hashes), point to version_1 or version_2
    # (by splitting all of the folders inside folder.iterdir(), can be in first or second index)
    # where the hash is, extract the code, and write it into depending if column in verdict is 0 or 1 folder
